# UserAgent.One API

> A fast API to use the [`user-agents`](https://github.com/intoli/user-agents) package directly from browser frontends.

## Why?

The `user-agents` package is one of the best ways to generate realistic, up-to-date user agent strings - but it runs in Node.js. This API makes it accessible from the frontend.

### Key Benefits:
- 🚀 **No Node.js needed** - works entirely from browser
- 📦 **No bloated bundles** - avoids bundling static UA lists
- 🔄 **Always fresh** - no reinstalls needed to update UAs
- 🔍 **Full filtering** - same powerful filtering as the original package

## Work in Progress
